# BlackjackGame
A simplified version of the casino game "Blackjack".
You can access the live link here: https://dyarmsh.github.io/BlackjackGame/


## The Rules
The AIM of the game is to get **21 points in total**. A (Ace) is considered 11 points, K,J,Q are considered 10 points and the rest are considered as their numeric value.

## "Start Game"
Start the game to see your first 2 cards. Depending on the message displayed, you can choose to continue if the sum of your cards is 21. If it is 21 points, then congrats! You got Blackjack! If you got more than 21 points, you'll have to start a new game :(

## "New Card"
When you have less than 21 points, you have an option to choose a new card and then, the game continues depending on the outcome of that new card...!

Enjoy!

* The cards are generated by random with the help of Math.random as well as some custom modifications in a getRandom() function.
